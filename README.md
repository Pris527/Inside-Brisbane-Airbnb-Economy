**Inside Brisbane’s Airbnb Economy**

**A data visualization project uncovering pricing, occupancy behaviour, and host performance across Brisbane’s short-stay rental market**

---

📌 **Project Overview — Why This Matters**

Airbnb continues to shape Brisbane’s housing and tourism economy — influencing affordability, neighbourhood character, and host profitability.

This dashboard tackles a key question:

**How do Airbnb pricing, occupancy and host performance vary across Brisbane — and what does this mean for hosts, investors, and future residents?**

This project originated from my own relocation planning — and evolved into a measurable look at short-stay market dynamics across the city.

---

**🎯 Objective**

This project analyses Brisbane Airbnb data to understand:

✔ Pricing differences across suburbs & room types
✔ How well listings convert into bookings
✔ Monthly revenue potential across the city

Everything — from data manipulation to dashboard design — was completed directly in **Tableau Public**.

**Revenue Estimation Formula:**

([Price] * 30 * 0.6) * [Reviews Per Month]

Review frequency used as a proxy for bookings, given dataset limitations.

🔍 **Key Insights**

📌 **Entire homes command higher prices — but not higher occupancy**
Mid-priced listings often outperform on demand.

📌 **Central suburbs dominate supply & revenue**
Location convenience drives performance.

📌 **Revenue is more seasonal than price**
Demand rises and falls with tourism rhythms.

📌 **Pricing strategy must balance competition**
High price ≠ high returns.

📌 **Market shows clear segmentation**
Traveller preferences differ by neighbourhood & listing type.

These insights support decision-making for:

• Hosts setting competitive pricing
• Investors assessing property strategy
• Housing & tourism analysts monitoring short-stays

⚠ **Critical Data Limitation** 

This dataset reflects **Airbnb listings only**, excluding hotels and other short-stay options.

Underrepresentation of hotels means:

• Airbnb occupancy appears **inflated**

• Competitive pressure is **understated**

• Market conclusions must be interpreted cautiously

Additionally:

Data is a **snapshot in time**, not continuously refreshed
→ Insights show **market structure**, not current season-specific performance

---

🚀 **Future Enhancements**

• Add geospatial mapping of density + revenue patterns

• Cluster listings by amenities and pricing power

• Integrate hotel capacity + tourism demand (ABS / Queensland data)

• Seasonal decomposition → identify peak vs slump drivers

• Host-focused recommendations, e.g., “optimal price band by suburb”

• Neighbourhood context profiles (universities, CBD access, event venues)

These align with a clear skill-development pathway while strengthening real-world value.
